# To-Do List
Proper (and simple) To-Do List based on the Hyperskill To-Do-List project. Done changes for better code readability, thanks to not being limited by their project validator. Now tasks are added by submitting the form rather than clicking add button. Every task element is created with createElement instead of shoehorning task text into ready-to-go HTML snippets. The tasks are now saved in localStorage by converting the array into JSON string. Additionally, done a visual overhaul giving the whole app a more suitable look.
